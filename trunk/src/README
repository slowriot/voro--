Voro++ library source files
===========================
c_loops.hh - header file the the container loop classes.

c_loops.cc - implementation file for the container loop classes.

cell.hh - header file for the voronoicell class and related classes.

cell.cc - implementation file for the voronoicell class and related classes.

cmd_line.cc - source file for creating the command-line utility that makes use
of the library.

common.hh - small common functions used throughout the library.

config.hh - configuration file for the library, controlling many memory
allocation an tolerance parameters.

container.hh - header file for the container class and related classes.

container.cc - implementation file for the container class and related classes.

container_prd.hh - header file for the container_periodic class and related
classes.

container_prd.cc - implementation file for the container_periodic class and
related classes.

Doxyfile - Configuration file for Doxygen, used to automatically generate
documentation based on the source code comments.

pre_container.hh - header file for the pre_container class and related classes.

pre_container.cc - implementation file for the pre_container class and related
classes.

rad_option.hh - header file for the class encapsulating how particle radius
information affects the tessellation.

v_base.hh - header file for the voro_base class that sets up constants determining
the underlying computational grid.

v_base.cc - implementation file for the voro_base class and related classes.

wall.hh - header file for the wall types.

wall.cc - implementation file for the wall types.

voro++.hh - a single header file that loads all the others.

voro++.cc - a single implementation file that loads all the others and their
headers.

worklist.hh - header file containing the parameters controlling the worklists.
This file is automatically generated by worklist_gen.pl.

worklist.cc - contains the precompiled worklists of block positions used for
rapid computation in the compute_cell() routine in the container class. This
file is automatically generated by worklist_gen.pl.

worklist_gen.pl - perl script for automatically generating the worklist.hh and
worklist.cc files.
