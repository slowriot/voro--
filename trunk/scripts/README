Voro++ helper scripts
=====================
This directory contains auxiliary helper perl scripts for use with the library.

random.pl - generates a random file of particles for testing the command-line
utility. Type "perl -h random.pl" for more information.

network.pl - creates a neighbor network plot from a .vol file created by the command
line utility using the -n option.

strip_degen.pl - parses POV-Ray files generated by the library and removes "degenerate
cylinders". See the code comments for more information.

sum.pl - sums the volumes in a .vol file created by the command line utility, for
checking purposes.
