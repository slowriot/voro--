Voro++, a 3D cell-based Voronoi library
=======================================
Voro++ is an object-oriented C++ library for the calculation of the 3D Voronoi
tessellation using a cell-by-cell construction.

Compilation
===========
The code is written in ANSI C++, and it should compile on many system architectures.
The compilation is configured in "config.mk" and is currently set to the GNU C++
compiler, g++. The command-line utility and example scripts can be compiled by
typing "make" in the top-level directory.

Contents
========
bin - a blank directory, into which the command-line utility is compiled
examples - many documented examples making use of the library
html - an HTML-based reference manual (generated by Doxygen)
latex - a LaTeX reference manual (generated by Doxygen)
scripts - miscellaneous helper scripts
src - source code files
