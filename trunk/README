Voro++, a 3D cell-based Voronoi library (http://math.lbl.gov/voro++/)
By Chris H. Rycroft (UC Berkeley / Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory)
================================================================
Voro++ is an object-oriented C++ library for the calculation of the 3D Voronoi
tessellation using a cell-by-cell construction. It is primarily designed for
applications in physics and materials science, where the Voronoi tessellation
can be a useful tool in the analysis of densely-packed particle systems, such
as granular materials or glasses.

Voro++ comprises of several C++ classes that can be modified and incorporated
into other programs. A command-line utility is also provided that can use most
features of the code.


Compilation
===========
The code is written in ANSI C++, and it should compile on many system
architectures. The compilation is configured in "config.mk" and is currently
set to the GNU C++ compiler, g++. The command-line utility and example scripts
can be compiled by typing "make" in the top-level directory. No external
dependencies are required to compile and run the code, but several programs may
be useful:

- The freeware plotting program Gnuplot (available at www.gnuplot.info) can be
  used for rapid 2D and 3D visualization of the program output.

- The freeware raytracer POV-Ray (available at www.povray.org) can be used for
  high-quality renderings of the program output.

- The reference manual is generated from comments in the source code using
  Doxygen (available at www.doxygen.org). This package is only required if the
  library files are being developed and the reference manuals need to be
  regenerated. The complete reference manual to the current code is available
  online at http://math.lbl.gov/voro++/doc/refman/


Contents

Usage
=====
Voro++ is released as free software through the Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory - a detailed copyright notice is provided below, and the complete
terms of the license can be found in the LICENSE file.

I am very interested to hear from users of the software, so if you find this
useful, please email me at chr@alum.mit.edu. Also, if you plan to publish an
academic paper using this software, please consider citing either or both of
the following publications:

  Phys. Rev. E 74, 021306 (2006).

The first reference contains some of the initial images that were made using a
very early version of this code, to track small changes in packing fraction in
a large particle simulation. The second reference discusses the use of 3D
Voronoi cells, and describes the algorithms that were employed in the early
version of this code. Since the publication of the above references, the
algorithms in Voro++ have been significantly improved, and a paper specifically
devoted to the current code architecture will hopefully be published during
2009.
