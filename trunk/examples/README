Voro++ example directory
========================
These directories contain example programs that make use of the Voro++ code,
and they are divided into six sections:

basic - this contains several simple scripts that introduce this basic classes
and carry out simple operations, such as constructing a single cell, or making
a Voronoi tessellation for a small number of a random particles in a box.

extra - this contains miscellaneous additional applications of the library for
non-standard usage.

radical - these programs demonstrate the codes ability to calculate the Voronoi
radical tessellation for a polydisperse packing of particles.

degenerate - these codes demonstrate cases when "degenerate" vertices of order
bigger than 3 are created, when the cutting planes are aligned to existing
vertices within the numerical tolerance.

timing - these programs and scripts can be used to test the performance of the
code under different configurations.

walls - these programs demonstrate the use of wall objects, to calculate the
Voronoi cells in non-standard geometries.
