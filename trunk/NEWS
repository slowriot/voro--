Version 0.3.0 (August 16, 2009)
===============================
* In response to feedback from several people, the routines for computing
  statistics about computed Voronoi cells have been significantly revised,
  extended, and put within a common framework. The voronoicell class now has a
  large number of routines of the form output_...() that will print cell
  information to an output stream. There are also a number of new, simple
  routines for computing basic statistics such as the number of edges and faces
  of each cell. All of these routines can now be used during the container
  analysis, by making use of the new print_custom() routine, which can output
  according to a given format string, that uses control sequences similar to
  the standard C printf() routine.
* Renamed the "radical" example directory to "custom", and added two
  new programs called "cell_statistics.cc" and "custom_output.cc" for
  demonstrating the new output routines for the voronoicell and container
  classes respectively
* Added a routine for computing the centroid of a Voronoi cell
* Added new routines for computing neighbor normals, in response to a
  request from Dave Greenwood
* Removed unnecessary trailing tabs and spaces in the source code
* Fixed a few text justification problems, and altered some of the comments
  in the example programs
* Improved the command-line utility, allowing it to specify custom information
  in the output. Implemented better error checking on command-line arguments.
* Updated Doxyfile to version 1.5.9

Version 0.2.7 (March 25, 2009)
==============================
* Added some missing cstdlib and cstring header files that cause compilation
  errors on some systems
* Some text cleanups in the main README file and cmd_line.cc
* The worklist_gen.pl script was in DOS format. It has been switched to Unix
  format to match the rest of the code.
* Fixed some incorrect inequalities in degenerate2.cc
* Improved some error messages in container.cc

Version 0.2.6 (March 23, 2009)
==============================
* Significantly improved the error messages generated by the code. It now
  makes use of the exit() routine rather than throwing errors, and it returns
  various status codes (defined in config.hh) for different types of abnormal
  behavior.
* Changed two occurences of "cin" to "cout" in the draw_particles routines
* Corrected error in comment in the tetrahedron example
* Minor comment cleanups of the worklist_gen.pl script
* Updated Doxyfile to version 1.5.8
* Added a routine print_facet_information() in response to a problem
  from Hengxing Lan
* Many of the cell based statistics routines (like number_of_faces() and
  facets()) internally track their progress by temporarily flipping the edge
  table entries to negative values, so that they know where they have already
  been. The common code that was used at the end of each of these functions for
  resetting the edges back to positive has now been made into a private inline
  function called reset_edges().
* Fixed a missing initialization of max_radius to zero in the radius_poly
  class. This should not have ever caused any errors, as max_radius would
  always have been big enough. However if max_radius was initially set to a
  large value, it could have potentially made the code run slower.
* Fixed the code layout in the suretest class header
* Added some additional checks in the command-line utility to screen out
  invalid command-line arguments. Switched the test on the number of
  computational blocks to use floating point arithmetic, because integers
  could potentially overflow and become negative.
* Included several more of the POV-Ray header files that were used to create
  the example images on the website
* Removed a "cout" statement in the wall_cone class
* Cleanup of the README files for the basic examples and the wall examples

Version 0.2.5 (January 1, 2009)
===============================
* Added the DOE acknowledgements to the code overview document

Version 0.2.4 (December 14, 2008)
=================================
* Added the code overview PDF document to the package, in the docs directory
* Fixed some spelling errors in the comments
* Many more documentation updates

Version 0.2.3 (December 9, 2008)
================================
* Removed an unused variable that was reported by the Portland C compiler
* Documentation updates
* Added the import.pov script
* Added some simple functions to solve the problem from Stefan Eibl of counting
  faces
* Renamed the facets_loop to voropp_loop

Version 0.2.2 (November 19, 2008)
=================================
* Main README file updated

Version 0.2.1 (November 3, 2008)
================================
* Much more documentation
* Brief Doxygen class comments
* Updated Doxyfile to version 1.5.7

Version 0.2 (October 31, 2008)
==============================
* Updated some occurrences of char* with const char* for compatability with
  version 4.2 of the GNU C++ compiler
* Making use of default parameters in the wall classes
* The command-line utility can now add walls

Version 0.1 (August 22, 2008)
=============================
