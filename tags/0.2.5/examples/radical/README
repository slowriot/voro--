Radical Voronoi tessellation examples
=====================================
Voro++ supports the radical Voronoi tessellation for polydisperse packings
where the cutting plane positions are displaced according to the particle
radii.

radical.cc loads in a small monodisperse packing in a cube of side length
six from the file pack_six_cube, and saves the Voronoi tessellation
to pack_six_cube.gnu. It then loads in a polydisperse packing in the same
geometry from the file pack_six_cube_poly, and it saves the radical Voronoi
tessellation to pack_six_cube_poly.gnu. These can be overlaid in gnuplot
using the commands:

set style data lines
splot 'pack_six_cube.gnu', 'pack_six_cube_poly.gnu'
